# ReactionGame

I programmed this game for a partner and myself to study the effects of UX in aircraft heads up displays (HUD) on attention to detail, reactivenss, and multitaksing in a training environment.

The game features two mini arcade games that one must controll with the arrow keys while also being aware of the status of information on the HUD. 

Set TEST_NUMBER in game_stuff.py to 1, 2, or 3 to initialize the game with different UX settings.
